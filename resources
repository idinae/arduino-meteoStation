//Luftdaten.info API "Pins"
https://github.com/opendata-stuttgart/sensors-software/blob/master/airrohr-firmware/Readme.md

For use of multiple sensors with Luftdaten.info, you need to specify a virtual API Pin for the use of Luftdaten.info
in the Luftdaten.info sensor registration. The firmware uses the following API pins hardcoded. 
These match what the Luftdaten.info expect and will use by default when selecting the correct sensor model.

HPM/PMS/SDS011/SPS30 => Pin 1
BMP180/BMP280 => Pin 3
DHT22/HTU21D/SHT3x => Pin 7
GPS(Neo-6M) => Pin 9
BME280 => Pin 11
DS18B20 => Pin 13
DNMS +> Pin 15
